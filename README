MORDOR-AUTH

Django Social Auth app for easy implementation of social signups into your django project.

If you are getting fbconnect error:
1. Goto allauth github repo.
2. Copy this and place it into your local allauth project file
   allauth/facebook/templates/facebook -> cp fbconnect.html and place it in your local allauth.
3. It should work fine!

Thanks for checking. Peace :)
